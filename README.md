This repository only contains the basic model of a bowling league. To generate code from the model Right click the model folder in the project → “New” → “Other…” → “EMF Generator Model” → “Next” and enter bowling.genmodel as the file name. Proceed to the next page and select “Ecore model” as the model importer. After clicking “Next”, select “Browse Workspace…” and select bowling.ecore. Go the next wizard page and select “Finish”. To generate the plugins, right-click on the root node of the generator model and select the plugin. We can also create specific instances of objects/classes in our model. Right click on the plugin containing the ecore file and select “Debug as → Eclipse Application”. This will start a new runtime Eclipse. Then, in the runtime, create a new empty project (Toolbar menu → “File” → “New” → ”Other…” → “General” → “Project”) named bowlinginstance.Right click the created project → “New” → “Other…” → “Example EMF Model Creation Wizards” → “Bowling Model” → “Next” and enter tournamnet.bowling as the name. This file will contain a serialized version of our model instance. Model element instances can be created via a right-click and EAttributes can be modified in the properties view
